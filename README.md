# KeepThis

an app for the things you want to remember

I'll be honest... I'm not quite sure what this application is just yet. For now, we'll call it a
personal passion project with two primary purposes:

1. Develop a Mobile Application - starting with a general concept of interest and exploring through
   ideas and possiblities to a fully functional, aesthetically attractive, well documented, deployed
   mobile application

2. Learning and Growth - build and improve my developer skillsets

### Application Concept

Big Idea: this is the notebook you carry around with you everyday, everywhere you go, so when you
realize you need to remember something you have a place to capture it

Architecture: flexible, needs to be able to be "stream of conscious" like a notebook but should also
have some structural organizations that make things easy to find and create conceptual packages like
"Ideas to Remember", "Health Tracker", or "Pet Project Board"

Interactions: again flexible, it has to be easy which means multiple options to accomodate different
interaction styles - typing, voice, selectors, buttons, widgets, reminders

Intital Project Ideas:

- recording, storing, searching ideas - entry via text and voice
- mood tracking like HYS
- morning check-in - how are you feeling? what is your top priority today?
- evening check-in - how are you feeling? what are you grateful for?

### Learning/Growth Goals

- learn React Native
- incorporate themes and customizable style schemes in css
- work with touch gestures
- develop habit of using github project board - including milestones and labels
- practice documenting my code work - use comments for each issue to explain the work to close the
  issue
