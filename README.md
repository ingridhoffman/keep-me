# KeepThis

or

# KeepMe

keep me organized, keep me on track, keep me from forgetting...

an app for the things you want to remember

I'll be honest... I'm not quite sure what this application is just yet. For now, we'll call it a
personal passion project with two primary purposes:

1. Develop a Mobile Application - starting with a general concept of interest and exploring through
   ideas and possiblities to a fully functional, aesthetically attractive, well documented, deployed
   mobile application

2. Learning and Growth - build and improve my developer skillsets

### Application Concept

Big Idea: this is the notebook you carry around with you everyday, everywhere you go, so when you
realize you need to remember something you have a place to capture it

Architecture: flexible, needs to be able to be "stream of conscious" like a notebook but should also
have some structural organizations that make things easy to find and create conceptual packages like
"Ideas to Remember", "Health Tracker", or "Pet Project Board"

- journal - stream of conscious, everything in the order in which it was entered
- modules can be logbooks, boards, lists, notebooks, etc. each with a basic structure to organize
  content

Interactions: again flexible, it has to be easy which means multiple options to accomodate different
interaction styles - typing, voice, selectors, buttons, widgets, reminders

Intital Project Ideas:

- recording, storing, searching ideas - entry via text and voice
- mood tracking like HYS
- morning check-in - how are you feeling? what is your top priority today?
- evening check-in - how are you feeling? what are you grateful for?
- hold that thought - too many thoughts keeping you from sleep? have a sudden idea but can't do
  anyting about it in the moment? capture thoughts so you can move on knowing the app will provide a
  full recap in the morning so you can sort ideas and add reminders

### Learning/Growth Goals

- learn React Native
- incorporate themes and customizable style schemes in css
- work with touch gestures
- develop habit of using github project board - including milestones and labels
- practice documenting my code work - use comments for each issue to explain the work to close the
  issue
